excerpt: some disparate thoughts on ai and it's general/everyday use
draft: false
---

some disparate thoughts on ai in no particular order and subject to perpetual revision:

- opting out of ai or not using ai[^1] is like trying to opt out of electricity when it was invented. this is not a value judgement but a claim about the state of the world
- in general, ai only produces [slop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_slop) and will likely continue to produce slop for the foreseeable future
    - defenders of ai (slop) have a vested interest in a future with less ai slop
- ai, like any technology, improves through iterative processes and refinement[^2], and this (probably necessarily) requires a collective suffering through its current iteration
    - 'it's bad today, but it'll be so good tomorrow' is the neoliberalism's perpetually deferred promise that promotes contemporary suffering in service of an unevenly distributed dystopian future
- ai is unlikely to replace any meaningful work, so long as the work is described and understood *as* meaningful
    - this is a massive problem given how much work (and life) has been rendered meaningless[^3]
    - 'useful' is the other word we could use here, especially given how we understand 'use' under capitalism
- all technology (broadly considered) has revolutionary potential, but it's potential and who/what directs that technology and benefits from it are unevenly and unequally distributed
    - what parts of luddism are worth hewing to or insisting on?
- we would do well to examine and reconsider the language with which we 'instruct' ai and communicate with it
    - ex. what do we learn from reading agent instructions not so much as machinic input but as language qua language
    - perhaps it's time to *really* revisit deleuze, but that's just me
- while thinking is surely altered by ai and its use, the moral panic about becoming somehow 'less human'[^4] by using it should be met with intense skepticism
- there is an active need to rethink both intelligence and cognition as they are used to describe ai and how disparate entities (again, broadly considered) possess either
    - see much work done in any kind of posthumanist or deconstructive thinking
- do our everyday, banal activities benefit significantly enough from ai to justify its cost?
    - what does this question enumerate or force us to enumerate in our attempt to answer?

[^1]: see, for example, [kyle chayka's article from the new yorker](https://www.new yorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/how-to-opt-out-of-ai-online), or various writing on our inability to avoid ai and/or companies shoehorning ai into any and all products
[^2]: 'refinement' is not implies a movement towards a specific goal, so that's probably not quite the right word here. instead, i'm trying to describe a meandering around in service of a particular end
[^3]: i make this claim or suggestion from the vantage that neoliberalism utilizes dehumanization as a primary engine
[^4]: following haraway, 'we have never been human'
