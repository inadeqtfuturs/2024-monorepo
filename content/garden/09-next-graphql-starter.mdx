excerpt: a minimal nextjs starter with graphql api routes backed by sequelize
draft: false
---

I recently started working on a new project and wanted to use NextJS across the stack. I thought it would be pretty straight forward to set up graphql api routes, but it ended up taking much longer to spin the project up than anticipated. I ended up abstracting the project architecture into a starter repo, which can be found [here](https://github.com/inadeqtfuturs/nextjs-sequelize-graphql-starter).

A brief overview:

- This is a full stack NextJS project that uses GraphQL api routes to interface with sequelize and a postgres database.
- The repo is diveded up into three sections: `database` for sequelize, `graphql` for the GraphQL schema and resolvers, and `src` for the frontend.
- Creating a new model is basically 2 steps: generate/define the model in sequelize, and then write the schema/resolvers in GraphQL.
- Because I was working on this while traveling (i.e. without internet access), it uses a project scope installed `sequelize-cli` and GraphQL Playground
- It frequently used sequelize commands aliased to `yarn`.
- The project can be deployed to Vercel or Netlify and hooked up to a Heroku hosted postgres (or whatever you prefer) database

The starter repo also comes with an example migration, model, and seed, as well as an example GraphQL schema and resolver with full CRUD operations.

If you're looking to quickly spin up a full stack NextJS project without configuring everything from scratch, this might be for you.
